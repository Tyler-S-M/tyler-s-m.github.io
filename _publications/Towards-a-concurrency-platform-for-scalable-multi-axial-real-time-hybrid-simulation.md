excerpt: 'SMulti-axial real-time hybrid simulation (maRTHS) uses multiple hydraulic actuators to apply loads and deform experimental substructures, enacting both translational and rotational motion. This allows for an increased level of realism in seismic testing. However, this also demands the implementation of multiple-input, multiple-output control strategies with complex nonlinear behaviors. To realize true real-time hybrid simulation at the necessary sub-millisecond timescales, computational platforms will need to support these complexities at scale, while still providing deadline assurance. This paper presents initial work towards supporting (and is influenced by the need for) envisioned larger-scale future experiments based on the current maRTHS benchmark: it discusses aspects of hardware, operating system kernels, runtime middleware, and scheduling theory that may be leveraged or developed to meet those goals. This work aims to create new concurrency platforms capable of managing task scheduling and adaptive event handling for computationally intensive numerical simulation and control models like those for the maRTHS benchmark problem. These should support real-time behavior at millisecond timescales, even for large complex structures with thousands of degrees of freedom. Temporal guarantees should be maintained across behavioral and computational mode changes, e.g., linear to nonlinear control. Pursuant to this goal, preliminary scalability analysis is conducted towards designing future maRTHS experiments. The results demonstrate that the increased capabilities of modern hardware architectures are able to handle larger finite element models compared to prior work, while imposing the same latency constraints. However, the results also illustrate a subtle challenge: with larger numbers of CPU cores, thread coordination incurs more overhead. These results provide insight into the computational requirements to support envisioned future experiments that will take the maRTHS benchmark problem to nine stories and beyond in scale. In particular, this paper (1) re-evaluates scalability of prior work on current platform hardware, and (2) assesses the resource demands of a basic smaller scale model from which to gauge the projected scalability of the new maRTHS benchmark as ever larger and more complex models are integrated within it.'
