excerpt: 'Multi-axial real-time hybrid simulation (maRTHS) uses multiple hydraulic actuators to apply loads and deform experimental substructures, enacting both translational and rotational motion. This allows for an increased level of realism in seismic testing. However, this also demands the implementation of multiple-input...'
