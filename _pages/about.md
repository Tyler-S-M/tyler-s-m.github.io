I am a first year student in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis advised by Chris Gill. Prior to my time in the program
here, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Missouri St. Louis. My research interests are in heterogeneous computing with a particular interest in GPU development, and parallel computing within real time constraints.

I am an avid Linux and CUDA enthusiast, with a significant amount of my free time going towards learning kernel development. Currently I am begining a 
deep dive into the relationship between GPUs and elastic scheduling within both fixed and mixed criticality models.
