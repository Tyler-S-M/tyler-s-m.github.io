I am a second year Ph.D. student in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis advised by Chris Gill. Prior to my time in the program here, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Missouri St. Louis. My research interests are in heterogeneous computing with a particular interest in GPU development, and online elastic scheduling with real time constraints.

I am an avid Linux and CUDA enthusiast. Currently, a significant amount of my research is related going towards how the internal schedulers within various CUDA capable devices behave and can be manipulated. I am also working on extending well established elasticity models to support heterogeneous systems for online adaptations.
